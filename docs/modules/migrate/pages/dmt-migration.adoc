= Migrate Your Data
:description: The DMT migrates your data for maps and replicated maps only, and can be run on Mac, Linux, and Windows Operating Systems.

{description}

NOTE:  The DMT does not migrate replicated map metadata.

The following clusters are used in the migration:

* Source cluster. This is your existing cluster, the one that you want to migrate

* Target Cluster. This is the new cluster to which you want to migrate the source cluster

* Migration cluster. This cluster is created by the custom Hazelcast distribution
+
The DMT uses the migration cluster to migrate data between your source and target clusters, as illustrated below:

== High-level Process

To migrate your data, you must complete the following steps:

. Configure the connections between clusters, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-connection-config.adoc[] topic
. Start the migration cluster, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-start-migration-cluster.adoc[] topic
. Shut down any applications using the source cluster in your usual way
. Use the DMT to run the migration, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-run.adoc[] topic
. Update your client configuration to match the target cluster details, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-clients.adoc[] topic

When the migration is complete, you can verify the following:

* The details of the migration, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-view-details.adoc[] topic
* The size of the map in the target cluster, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-view-data.adoc[] topic

TIP: You can test a migration using a Development cluster, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-dev-test.adoc[] topic. 

== Get the DMT

To use the DMT, you must first https://repository.hazelcast.com/data-migration/com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-distribution/[download the package] for your currect version.

Once downloaded, extract the DMT package to a location in your folder structure. The DMT package includes the following:

* The DMT
+
You must use the DMT binary that is suitable for your machine. The DMT binaries are in the _bin_ folder of the extracted DMT package with filenames in `dmt_[platform]_[arch]` format.  Use the ``arm64`` binary for ARM, and the `amd64` binary for Intel.

* A custom Hazelcast distribution that creates a migration cluster and runs the data migration service
* Example configuration files
* Example connection configuration file, which is used to connect to the migration client

== Limited Migration Cluster License

A 10-node limited license is included for use with your migration cluster. 

This license is valid for 30 days and can be used only for data migration and trial purposes.
