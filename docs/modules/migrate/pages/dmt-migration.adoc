= Migrate Your Data
:description: The DMT migrates your data for maps and replicated maps, compact serialization schemas, and CP data structures. It can be run on Mac, Linux, and Windows Operating Systems.

{description}

NOTE: To migrate Replicated metadata, you must include the provided JAR in your class path. The source cluster must be restarted after the addition of the JAR.

The following clusters are used in the migration:

* Source cluster. This is your existing cluster, the one that you want to migrate

* Target Cluster. This is the new cluster to which you want to migrate the source cluster

* Migration cluster. This cluster is created by the custom Hazelcast distribution
+
The DMT uses the migration cluster to migrate data between your source and target clusters, as illustrated below:

== High-level Process

To migrate your data, you must complete the following steps:

. Configure the connections between clusters, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-connection-config.adoc[] topic
. Start the migration cluster, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-start-migration-cluster.adoc[] topic
. Shut down any applications using the source cluster in your usual way
. Use the DMT to run the migration, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-run.adoc[] topic
. Update your client configuration to match the target cluster details, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-clients.adoc[] topic

When the migration is complete, you can verify the following:

* The details of the migration, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-view-details.adoc[] topic
* The size of the map in the target cluster, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-view-data.adoc[] topic

TIP: You can test a migration using a Development cluster, as described in the xref:migrate:dmt-dev-test.adoc[] topic. 

== Get the DMT

To use the DMT, you must first https://repository.hazelcast.com/data-migration/com/hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise-distribution/[download the package] for your current version.

Once downloaded, extract the DMT package to a location in your folder structure. The DMT package includes the following:

* The DMT
+
You must use the DMT binary that is suitable for your machine. The DMT binaries are in the _bin_ folder of the extracted DMT package with filenames in `dmt_[platform]_[arch]` format.  Use the ``arm64`` binary for ARM, and the `amd64` binary for Intel.

* A custom Hazelcast distribution that creates a migration cluster and runs the data migration service
* Example configuration files
* Example connection configuration file, which DMT uses to connect to the migration cluster
