= Which Tool Should I Use?
:description: This flow chart will help you determine which upgrade or migration tool you should use for your Hazelcast cluster.

{description} 

Hazelcast provides several different options for upgrading your Hazelcast cluster and/or migrating your data from one cluster to another. 

* The Data Migration Tool (DMT): Migrate data from your Open Source or Enterprise clusters running Hazelcast 4.0 or later, to either an Enterprise cluster or a cluster on Hazelcast Viridian. xref:data-migration-tool.adoc[]
* Data Synchronization using Active/Active WAN Replication: Used to migrate data and active clients from one Enterprise cluster to another Enterprise cluster. xref:wan:wan.adoc[]
* 3.12 Migration jar: A specialized tool for migrating data only from a 3.12 cluster to the latest version of Hazelcast. xref:migration-tool.adoc[]
* Rolling Upgrade: Upgrades your existing 4.0 or later Enterprise cluster to the latest version of Hazelcast with no service interruption. xref:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc[]

The method you use will depend on your version of Hazelcast and your operational conditions. This flow chart will guide you through the process of determining which method is available for your environment. Note that some options, such as data migration from one open source cluster to another open source cluster, are not available.

The questions in the flow chart:

* Are you running Open Source or Enterprise Edition of Hazelcast?
* Is your version of Hazelcast 4.0 or later?
* Can you upgrade your existing cluster, or do you need to create a new cluster with the new version?
* Can you tolerate operational downtime?
* Can your client applications switch to the new cluster all at once, or do you need to support both clusters for some time period?
* Can the source cluster be restarted?
* Do you need to maintain per key linearization (in other words, only one cluster holds a given key), or can your applications support eventual consistency?

Once you have determined your upgrade/migration option, follow the above link for the selected method for usage instructions.
